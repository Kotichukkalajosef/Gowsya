            My love for you is like a candle that never fades, a flame that
            neither time nor distance could extinguish. For nine years, my heart
            has whispered your name in the silence of the night. Even when the
            world moved on, even when the seasons changed, my love for you
            remained‚Äîuntouched, unshaken, eternal.

            You were never just a person to me‚Äîyou were my universe. Every star

            and every raindrop reminded me of your touch. Even today, as I walk
            alone, I find you in everything‚Äîyour laughter echoes in the wind,
            and your absence lingers in my every breath.

            Loving you is like holding onto the sharpest thorn, yet I never let
            go. I would rather bleed with your memory than heal without you.
            Every time I see something beautiful, I think of you. Every time I
            close my eyes, I dream of you. Do you ever think of me? Do you ever
            remember the love that once held you so close? I do. Every second,
            every day.

            I never needed you to love me back to keep loving you. My love does
            not demand a return; it exists simply because it is meant to. Even
            when you walked away, my heart chose to stay behind. I have never
            resented your absence; I have only embraced the emptiness you left
            behind, filling it with memories of us.

            I have written a thousand letters to you in my heart, but I have
            never sent them. I have spoken to you in my dreams, but never in
            reality. I have held you in my thoughts for so long that you have
            become a part of me. But love, in its truest form, does not always
            need to be spoken. Sometimes, it just exists‚Äîquietly, painfully,
            beautifully.
